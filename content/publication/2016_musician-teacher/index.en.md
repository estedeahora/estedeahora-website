title: The musician and the teacher
subtitle: Reflections on the role of music pedagogy in primary school. Research notes

abstract: "Based on an ongoing research project, the present article reflects on the educational actors´ representations of the music class´s role, and its place in the primary level educational structure (Buenos Aires, Argentina). From the analysis of the interviews, the ‘school assembly’ stands out as a structuring element of the music teaching practice. The article sustains the need to understand it as a cultural arbitrary. The ‘school assembly’ agglutinates and gives sense to the music teacher´s practice, constituting his habitus; while it limits the place of music education in the educational field. To end with, the article outlines some consequences, concerning: firstly, the social reproduction and the educational inequality; and secondly, the place of music education in the educational field."
