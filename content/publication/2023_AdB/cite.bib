  abstract = {The low-income group’s city insertion is structured concerning a wide range of state interventions articulated in a general system defining the architecture of well-being and collaborating in the development of urban environments supportive and egalitarian. By providing infrastructures, services, and equipment, the State becomes an engine of stratification and socio-territorial differentiation. Our paper investigates how access to urban resources, in general, and to infrastructures, services, and equipment impact the production of socio-spatial inequalities in the City of Buenos Aires. It uses different public data sources on infrastructures and services combined through a quantitative analysis that integrates different statistical techniques. Likewise, it uses interviews with key informants to understand better how public resources operate in access to well-being and the role of territorial-based social networks in that context.},
