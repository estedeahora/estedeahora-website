I am developing my Doctoral program at the *Faculty of Social Sciences (UBA)*, as part of the *Area of Urban Studies (IIGG-UBA)*. My work is focused on the use of data analysis techniques and statistical programming focused on the area of Urban Studies.

I am currently dedicated to the study of urban segregation, with special attention to the way in which segregation is articulated in different domains of social life. My Master's Thesis addresses the relationship between educational and territorial inequalities in CABA (*MGAIE-UNTREF*).
