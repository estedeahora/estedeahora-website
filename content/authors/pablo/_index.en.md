I am a PhD student in social science at the *Faculty of Social Sciences (Universidad de Buenos Aires)*, as part of the *Urban Studies Area (IIGG-UBA)*. My work is focused on the use of data analysis techniques and statistical programming in the fields of Urban Studies and Social Science.

My Master's Thesis addresses the relationship between educational and territorial inequalities in CABA (*MGAIE-UNTREF*). I am currently dedicated to the study of urban segregation, with special attention to the way in which segregation is articulated in different domains of social life.
